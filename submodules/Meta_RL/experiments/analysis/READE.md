# Analysis

This directory contains functions/scripts for evaluating trained models.
The functions plot training progress and test the trained agents by rolling
out several episodes.

**Important**: You need ``MRL-analysis-tools`` in order to use these functions.
This is a separate package which is also uploaded on GitHub. Contact me (Julius
Durmann) if you need access.
